# Tip #2: Iterative Refinement

**Date**: 2026-02-20  
**Category**: Prompt Engineering  
**Difficulty**: Beginner

## The Tip

Don't expect perfect output on first try. Use follow-up prompts: "Make it shorter", "Add more detail about X", "Change the tone to be more formal".

## Why It Works

This technique leverages how LLMs process and generate text. By structuring your input strategically, you guide the model toward better outputs.

## Example

Try it yourself with your next prompt and compare results.
