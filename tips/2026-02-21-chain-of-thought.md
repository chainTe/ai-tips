**Category**: Prompt Engineering  
**Difficulty**: Beginner

## The Tip

When asking complex questions, add "Think step by step" to get more accurate reasoning. LLMs perform better when they "show their work" rather than jumping to conclusions.

## Why It Works

This technique leverages how LLMs process and generate text. By structuring your input strategically, you guide the model toward better outputs.

## Example

Try it yourself with your next prompt and compare results.
